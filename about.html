          <p class="p1"><h5 font-family:Fantasy	Copperplate;>about</h5> Sri Dalada Maligava is the palace where the Buddha's left tooth relic is currently enshrined.
            The present Dalada Maliga is located in the city of Kandy in Sri Lanka. 
            During the Upland Kingdom, this was located in the royal palace complex that existed at that time. 
            Sri Dalada Palace was originally built by King Wimaladharmasuriya.The palace he built was destroyed by the Portuguese invaders. The old two-storied palace that is seen today was built by King Sri Weeraparakrama Narendrasinghe (1707 - 1739). Even the Dravidian kings of the Nayakkar dynasty who came to reign later improved and protected the Sri Dalada Palace.

            The city of Kandy itself , where the Palace of the Tooth is located, has been named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO . The Lords of both the Malwatu and Asgiri sects of the Siam sect offer daily offerings to the Buddha. This puja (theva) is performed three times a day (morning, noon and evening). Nanumura festival is held as a special puja on Wednesdays. Here, the tooth is symbolically bathed in scented medicinal water. 
            It is believed that the water obtained from bathing has the power to cure diseases.

            is located in Udunuwara Mada Province of Kandy District. There is an intersection called Daulagala on the highway from Peradeniya to Ambilmigama. 
            This temple is built in the middle of a village with a field which is found after about half a mile on the road leading from there to Gangaha.

            The historical legend regarding the construction of this temple is well explained in the poetic work "Ambakke Varnanava". 
            A famous story is believed to have led to the construction of the Ambakke temple. A drummer living in the village of Rangama was cured of leprosy after he went to Kataragama and prayed. So he went there every year and beat the drums and gave thanks to the Kandasuridans. Later, when the old man was sad because he couldn't go there, one day Surindu of Kataragama came to him in a dream and said, "Don't be afraid, go to the village. In a few days, show me a sign with a tree, and I will visit you. Then the wedding drums will be played." Later, while cutting the thorn bushes in the flower garden of Ambakke, which belonged to Queen Bandara Devi, Queen Vikramabahu's concubine, a stream of blood came out from a kadu tree there. Later, the drummer told the king the dream he had seen, so the king made a three-storied foot like a deva vimanak there.
             It was called Ambakke Temple.

          <p class="p1"><h5>about</h5>The Ceylon Tea Museum is located in the former Hanthana Tea Factory, which was originally constructed in 1925. It is situated 3 km (1.9 mi) south of Kandy.

            Hanthana was one of the first successful areas to cultivate tea following the failure of coffee production on the island. In 1959 the Tea Research Institute of Ceylon established a sub station on land leased from the Hanthana Estate, similar to the Passara sub station established in the 1920s. The Hanthana Station was set up to cater to the needs of mid-country tea plantations with regard to the physiology, entomology of tea and in particular the identification of drought resistant clones and the insect pest shot-hole borer.
            
            The Ceylon Tea Museum was incorporated on 9 January 1998, under Section 21 of the Companies Act of 1982, in a move initiated by Clifford Ratwatte . The museum was formally opened on 1 December 2001.
            
            The four storey tea factory had been abandoned for more than a decade before it was refurbished in 2001 by the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Planters’ Association of Sri Lanka. The museum contains exhibits on tea pioneers, including James Taylor and Thomas Lipton, as well as much vintage tea-processing paraphernalia. The ground floor houses 19th century colonial generators, rollers, dryers, fermentation tables, sorting machines, etc. The second floor houses the library and museum. The third floor has a shop whilst the top floor contains a restaurant and tea rooms.
